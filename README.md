# Landing Page Project
2th project at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011) Front End Web Development Nanodegree program.

## Instructions
The starter project from Udacity has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

## Building Tools
HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Project Features
* Sticky/Fixed Menu.
* Interactive Landing Page.
